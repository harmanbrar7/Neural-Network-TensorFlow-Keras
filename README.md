# Neural-Network-TensorFlow-Keras
Building a neural network using TF, Keras &amp; NumPy (multiple examples)

# Instructions

run the neurons file first, then coffee roasting and then coffee roasting numpy

we implement tensorflow to build a neural network that predicts a simple human task
using a few paramters (in this case is how well a coffee is roasted, using time and temperature)

one can easily extend this to include many more parameters 

all code is interactive and informational, some blocks may take a few mins to run
